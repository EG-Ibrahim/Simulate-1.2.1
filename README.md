This was my first ever coding project.

I had made this project for a competition I had at my school for which I got 3rd place, beating a few of my seniors.

It is a 3D shooter game, with very simple graphics and follows a simple storyline with just a few levels.

This game is honestly not that special in terms of what it is or what it offers.

But I am proud of it as I had managed to make this at a point when I had only just started off my programming journey.

(I didn't know a single programming language and only knew a little bit of Pseudocode when I made this, which was being taught at my school)
